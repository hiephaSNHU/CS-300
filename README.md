**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The projects focused on creating an advising assistance program to help academic advisors manage course information efficiently. Project One required analyzing data structures for runtime and memory efficiency, while Project Two involved building a program that could sort and display courses in alphanumeric order.
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I examined several data structures—Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree (BST)—to find the best balance between memory usage and performance. I chose the BST for its ability to maintain sorted data and support efficient lookups, crucial for handling and displaying course data.
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
One challenge was ensuring the input file loaded correctly. I solved this by adding error-checking code and verifying file formatting. For BST issues, I reviewed tree balancing concepts and tested with different data sets to ensure accurate sorting and retrieval.
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
These projects reinforced the importance of thoughtful data organization and choosing efficient structures. I learned to design software with performance and functionality in mind, using data structure selection as a foundation for effective program design.
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I focused on writing clear, modular code with consistent naming and comments, making it easier to understand and modify. Structuring code for readability helps ensure future adaptability, whether by me or other developers.
